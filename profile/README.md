# Hi there, we're [Antiwork](https://antiwork.com)! 👋

## 🙋‍♀️ On a mission to make work play.
Antiwork emerged from Gumroad's mission to automate repetitive tasks. In 2025, we're taking a bold step by open-sourcing our entire suite of tools that helped run and scale Gumroad. We believe in making powerful automation accessible to everyone.
