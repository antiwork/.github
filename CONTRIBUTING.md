# Contributing to Antiwork Projects

## Commenting on GitHub

Use native-sounding English in all communication with no excessive capitalization (e.g HOW IS THIS GOING), multiple question marks (how's this going???), grammatical errors (how's dis going), or typos (thnx fr update).
- ❌ Before: "is this still open ?? I am happy to work on it ??"
- ✅ After: "Is this actively being worked on? I've started work on it here…"

Check existing discussions/issues/PRs before creating new ones. Start a discussion for questions or ideas.

## Issues

A great bug report includes:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We don't assign issues to contributors until they have a history of contributions to the project.

## Pull Requests (code)

### General best practices

- Update documentation if you're changing behavior
- Add or update tests for your changes–any functional changes should reflect in updated/new end-to-end tests
- Include screenshots of your test suite passing locally if the build doesn't run automatically
- Make sure **all** tests pass
- Request a review from one maintainer
- After reviews begin, avoid force-pushing to your branch
   - Force-pushing rewrites history and makes review threads hard to follow
   - Don't worry about messy commits - we squash everything when merging to main
- **Must**: Self-review your PR with explanatory comments for any non-intuitive or non-obvious changes to help reviewers understand your reasoning
- **Must**: Pull requests' code should be 100% related to the issue being solved. Anything unrelated should be moved into its own atomic PR
- Newlines at end of files, always

### Front-end

- Follow the existing code patterns
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Write TypeScript for all code
- Follow Next.js and React conventions
- Use UpperCamelCase for component file names (e.g., `ConversationList.tsx`)
- Always use the latest version of TypeScript, React, and Next.js
- Use sentence case headers and buttons, not title case (Add board is good, Add Board is bad)
- Do not use `React.FC`. Use the following syntax: `const Component = ({ prop1, prop2 }: { prop1: string; prop2: number }) => { ... }`
- When building UI, use existing components from `components/` when available: `Button`, `Input`, `DataTable`, `Placeholder`, `ComboBox`, `NumberInput`, `MutationButton`, `Dialog`, `Form` components, etc.
- When creating new components using Shadcn, use the `canary` version over the `latest` version

### Back-end

- Follow the existing code patterns
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Write TypeScript for all code
- Use Prisma best practices for database operations
- Any changes to the back-end database schema must be reflected in any existing frontend schema files for type safety

### Design / UX

- Design for both light and dark mode
- Consider mobile and desktop devices (small, medium, large, and extra large breakpoints)
- Forms for adding new objects to the database should inherit values from the last object added to the table

### Testing Guidelines

- Write descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- For API endpoints, test response status, format, and content
- Use factories for test data instead of creating objects directly
- Test both happy path and edge cases

## AI Assistance Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you are using **any kind of AI assistance** to contribute to Antiwork,
> it must be disclosed in the pull request.

If you are using any kind of AI assistance while contributing to Antiwork,
**this must be disclosed in the pull request**, along with the extent to
which AI assistance was used (e.g. docs only vs. code generation).
If PR responses are being generated by an AI, disclose that as well.
As a small exception, trivial tab-completion doesn't need to be disclosed,
so long as it is limited to single keywords or short phrases.

An example disclosure:

> This PR was written primarily by Claude Code.

Or a more detailed disclosure:

> I consulted ChatGPT to understand the codebase but the solution
> was fully authored manually by myself.

If no AI assistance was used, please state explicitly:

> No AI was used to generate any of this code.

Failure to disclose this is first and foremost rude to the human operators
on the other end of the pull request, but it also makes it difficult to
determine how much scrutiny to apply to the contribution.

In a perfect world, AI assistance would produce equal or higher quality
work than any human. That isn't the world we live in today, and in most cases
it's generating slop. I say this despite being a fan of and using them
successfully myself (with heavy supervision)!

Please be respectful to maintainers and disclose AI assistance.
